At the line 140 you can find scenario for simulate the elevator.

You can change the setting for example:


# # Create object
# column = Column(10, 2)

inside the Column(x, y)

x: is the number of columns
y: is the number of elevators


# column.elevatorList[0].currentPosition = 2
# column.elevatorList[0].direction = "idle"
# column.elevatorList[0].status = "idle"

inside [] you can chose an item in the array by using the index

You can change the current position (starting point of the elevator)
You can change the direction: Up or Down
you can change the status: idle, moving or stopped
