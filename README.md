# Elevator Algorithm

The program is a controller used in a 10 storey building served by two elevators cages. This controller is capable of supporting two main events:  
  
1. A person presses a call button to request an elevator, the controller selects an available cage and it is routed to that person based on two parameters provided by pressing the button:  
  
   a. The floor where the persone is.  
   b. The direction (Up or Down).  
     
   *It should be noted, an elevator already in motion (or stopped but have other request) should be prioritized versus an "Idle" elevator.

2. A person enters an elevator, supports a floor of the control panel and it moves to thte floor requested. The parameters provided are:  
  
   a. The elevator used.  
   b. The request floor.
